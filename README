My name is Shuhao Lai.
My JHED is slai16.
For my program, I focused a lot on readibility over functionality; however, I did aadbandon optimization.
As I worked along the program, I just added a method for sections of code I believe could be applicable to other programs.
I also tried to generalized my functions. For example, in my string_to_nums function, I made it take care of cases for when
the arugment is not really a num, but also contains letters. I also made it take care of negative numbers. I thought the sort methods
were the hardest because they were the most new to me. I originally attempted to sort a map, but then I realized that maps
don't really have an order as they do not have indexes. This is why I decided to use a vector<pair> for most of the program. Lastly,
I tried to make my program as robust as possible, which means handling negative numbers, invalid arguments, and much more. Overall I enjoyed
this programming assignment.
